As requested, here is the project containing the scripts for the solution of the different challeges proposed in the repo [IFCO Data Engineering Challenge](https://github.com/Digital-IFCO/data-engineering-test/tree/main). In the `ifcoenv` folder you can find the virtual environment, in the `resources` folder you can find the `.json` and the `.csv` files provided to solve the test, in the `scripts` folder you can find the solution to each exercise and in the `tests` folder you can find the unit tests for each exercise.

## 🚀 Introduction

The technologies used for this development are:

- _Python 3.11.3_
- _IDE Visual Code_
- _Git 2.40.1.windows.1_
- _Github_
- _Microsoft PowerBI 2.137.952.0_

## 📝 Installation

__1.__ Clone the repo using

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Angelica2298/IFCO-Project.git
```

__2.__ Open Visual Studio Code

__3.__ Navigate to repository path

```bash
cd /repository_path
```

__4.__ Activate virtual environment

```bash
ifcoenv\Scripts\activate
```

## 🏃 Execution

- In the folder `scripts` you will find the solution to each exercise, indicated by the number of the specific test.
- In the folder `tests` you will find the Unit Tests of every exercise, also indicated by its number.

E.g.: `tests/Test1.py` is the **Unit test** file of `scripts/Exercise1.py` script.

Run each script separately and validate that the console Output information is correct, then run the corresponding Unit Test script.
