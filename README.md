As requested, here is the project containing the scripts for the solution of the different challeges proposed in the repo [IFCO Data Engineering Challenge](https://github.com/Digital-IFCO/data-engineering-test/tree/main). In the `ifcoenv` folder you can find the virtual environment, in the `resources` folder you can find the `.json` and the `.csv` files provided to solve the test, in the `scripts` folder you can find the solution to each exercise and in the `tests` folder you can find the unit tests for each exercise.

## 🚀 Introduction

The technologies used for this development are:

- _Python 3.11.3_
- _IDE Visual Code_
- _Git 2.40.1.windows.1_
- _Github_
- _Microsoft PowerBI 2.137.952.0_

## 📝 Installation

 __1.__ Clone the repo using

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Angelica2298/IFCO-Project.git
```

 __2.__ Open Visual Studio Code

 __3.__ Navigate to repository path

```bash
cd /repository_path
```

 __4.__ Activate virtual environment

```bash
ifcoenv\Scripts\activate
```

## 🏃‍♀️ Execution

- In the folder `scripts` you will find the solution to each exercise, indicated by the number of the specific test.
- In the folder `tests` you will find the Unit Tests of every exercise, also indicated by their number.

> [!NOTE]  
> E.g.: `tests/Test1.py` is the **Unit test** file of `scripts/Exercise1.py` script.

Run each script separately and validate that the console Output information is correct, then run the corresponding Unit Test script.

## 🖼️ Power BI Test 6

For the _Test 6: Data Visualization_ you can download the file **_IFCO Project.pbix_** in folder `Power BI - Test 6` and open it with _Microsoft Power BI_.

### Description

The report contains **5 main visualizations** that explain the sales performance of the company's salespeople with an emphasis on their sales of plastic crates, in order to determine which salespeople have had the highest sales over time and who need training to improve their sales.

One of the visuals explains the distribution of sales by the types of crates the company offers to its customers and the evolution of these sales.

In addition, and to get more detail, there is a group of filters that allow you to segment the information by _year, company name and city_.
